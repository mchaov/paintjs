# paintjs

Simple MSPaint like application developed in JS. But why ...

1. I can
2. I don't have a lot of experience with programatically manipulating SVG prior to this project
3. I can ... and I want to :)

## Installation

```npm install```
```npm run dev```

## But it doesn't work...

It is still in development, duh...
